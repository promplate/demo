Below is a dialogue between `USER_A` and `USER_B`:
{% for msg in messages -%}
{% if msg.role == "user" -%}
USER_A: {{ repr(msg.content) -}}

{% elif msg.role == "assistant" -%}
USER_B: {{ repr(msg.content) -}}

{% endif -%}
{% endfor -%}
<| user |>
Please envisage 2-5 possible responses / follow-up questions for `USER_A` to reply `USER_B`.

Note: Each answer must be fundamentally different.
For example, if it is a general question, one affirmative answer and one negative answer will suffice.

You must provide valuable and enlightening responses rather than platitudes like just thanking `USER_B`.
And they should be as concise as possible, with no duplication whatsoever.

Please present your answer as a JSON list.

Schema: `list[str]` in python, or `string[]` in typescript.
Your response should be something like this:
["...","...","..."]

Yes, do not contain anything else besides the json list.

Remember: You MUST use THE SAME LANGUAGE as `USER_A`!
